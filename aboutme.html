		<h3><center>Half a year ago, I decided to pursue an art degree in OCAD University, thinking that this was the most exciting and challenging decision in my life. 
Iâ€™m majoring in Digital Futures. My program is about using art and technologies to solve problems, deal with contemporary issues, and create future possibilities, it could be virtual reality, augmented reality development, games, wearable technology, etc. I really hope I can do something to help people's lives better by creating art, and using technology is one effective way, that's the reason why I decided to pursue this career.
I enjoy creating contents, designing, solving problems or coming up with ideas to help things work fluently. I often spend time observing things around myself and try to think of how they work and what if they could do better. I think this is one of my strengths that I always look for something different, innovative and unique to transform and make them better.</center>
